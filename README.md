---

Personal website built with ASP.NET Core and React, hosted on GitHub pages.

## Getting  Started

The ASP.NET Core SPA environment handles routes to `index.html`, which otherwise would cause issues by attempting to load the literal path; a script is used as a workaround for hosting in GitHub Pages ([rafrex/spa-github-pages](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages)).

### Prerequisites

- [.NET Core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Quick Start

```shell
cd ./src/Hypzeh.Web/
npm install
npm run start
```

## Usage

Node (`npm`) commands require `package.json` which is located at the project level directory (`/src/*/*.csproj`).

### Node

```shell
npm install
```

Installs all module dependencies to the `node_modules` directory.

```shell
npm run start
```

Starts the development server running on `http://localhost:8080`.

```shell
npm run build
```

Builds the client application with webpack for production; optimises and minifies all files, output is in the `wwwroot` folder.

> Note: `404.html` and `CNAME` files are manually placed in the `wwwroot` folder and are not generated by webpack - They need to be included for GitHub pages, to handle routes, and should not be removed. The contents of `wwwroot` needs to be pushed to `master` branch to go live.

```shell
npm run test
```

- Runs ESLint
- Runs stylelint

### .NET Core

```shell
dotnet build
```

Builds the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries. 

> Note: MSBuild will trigger the `npm install` command, when building the .NET Core project for the first time and/or not having `node_modules` dependencies directory.

```shell
dotnet run
```

Runs the application using .NET Core runtime on `http://localhost:5000`.

> Note: MSBuild will trigger the `npm run build` command. This doesn't support hot reloading.
