---

Personal website built with ASP.NET Core and React, hosted on GitHub pages.

## Usage

```shell
cd ./src/Hypzeh.Web/
npm install
npm run start
```

> Note: Building the ASP.NET Core project for the first time (not having `node_modules` dependencies), will trigger the `npm install` command by MSBuild.

### Install

```shell
npm install
```

Installs all module dependencies.

### Development

```shell
npm run start
```

Starts the development server running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Build

```shell
npm run build
```

Builds the client application with webpack for production; optimises and minifies all files, output is in the `wwwroot` folder.

> Note: `404.html` and `CNAME` files are manually placed in the `wwwroot` folder and are not generated by webpack - They need to be included for GitHub pages, and should not be removed. The contents of `wwwroot` needs to be pushed to `master` branch to go live.

### Lint

```shell
npm run test
```

- Runs ESLint
- Runs stylelint
